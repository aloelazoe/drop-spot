this is a little app for sharing files

it needs node.js and npm to setup and run

you will need to generate tls certificates for secure https connection (see main.js)

create a folder named 'share' in the project folder and place files that you want to share in there

files that are uploaded to the server will be saved in 'uploads' folder
